# Copyediting, proofreading and review

These services are for more polished drafts. I can:

- proofread the draft, correcting spelling, grammatical and formatting errors
- suggest language edits to improve the style and make the draft clearer
- review the draft and leave feedback on the content: does the argument make sense? Will your non-expert readers understand? Are there any obvious objections you haven’t addressed? What might make the draft more engaging?

## Prices

- basic proofreading: £0.01 per word
- copyediting and review: £0.02-£0.04 per word. The price depends on how intensive the edits are and how complex the subject matter is. This also includes proofreading.

£50 is the minimum price for any of these services (regardless of word count).

# Substantive editing

I will substantively rewrite a rough draft, preserving your meaning but rephrasing and restructuring the piece to make it clearer and more engaging.

**£0.06** per word, with £50 minimum.

# Quick review

I spend up to an hour correcting obvious errors, suggesting priority edits, and giving my overall impressions on the content. Appropriate if you just want someone to take a quick look.

£40

# Writing coaching

I offer writing and editing guidance over calls.

I’ve thought a lot about what makes writing good. I can help you with everything from the nuts and bolts of sentence structure, to writer’s block, to the best way to convey your arguments.

## Price

£40 per hour

# Writing assistance

I can help you write things even if you haven’t written a draft yet. This could involve some combination of:

- coaching and collaboration calls
- writing drafts
- editing rough drafts/notes

## Pricing

- £0.12/word for producing content from scratch
- £0.06/word for substantive editing of rough drafts
- £0.02-£0.04/word for copyediting
- £40/hour for calls, additional research, and miscellaneous
