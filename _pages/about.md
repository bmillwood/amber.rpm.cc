I’m a freelance writer and editor for people who want to make the world better. I’ve worked a lot with members of the [effective altruist](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) community, but I’m happy to work with anyone who has interesting ideas that they want to share.

I was born and raised in the Scottish countryside, and I now live in London. Before I was doing this, I was pursuing a PhD (that I never finished) in Greek and Roman philosophy. My interests include teaching, mental health, emotions, philosophy, and relationships.
